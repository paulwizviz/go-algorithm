# Go Algorithm and Data Structure

A collect of algorithms and data structure implemented in Go.

## Algorithm

* [Sort](./sort/doc.md)
* Search

## Data Structures

* Lists: Ordered collections of elements with operations like insertion, deletion, and searching.
* Stacks: Last-in, first-out (LIFO) collections with operations like push and pop.
* Queues: First-in, first-out (FIFO) collections with operations like enqueue and dequeue.
* [Trees](./tree/doc.md): Hierarchical data structures with nodes and edges.
* Graphs: Collections of nodes and edges representing relationships between entities.
* Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements.
* Maps (or Dictionaries): Collections of key-value pairs.
